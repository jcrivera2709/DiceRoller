        Hello, as you can tell my name is Jose Carlo Rivera Santiago.
        \n\n I am going to write about my best memories from high school, which would be my cross country team.
        \n I still remember one of the most important races of my high school career.
        \n Junior year of high school we were going against our rival school called Spanish River High School.
        \n We were lined up an ready to race, our school does the signature calf slapping and get riled up ready to
        race.
        \n We go up to the starting line, heads down and complete silence.
        \n 3...2...1...BANG!
        \n As quick as it started , it was over.
        \n I finished 3rd for my team and 8th in the region with a 17:24 for a 5k.
        \n It finally came down to the team points, they score based on placement 1st place gets 1 point , 2nd place
        gets 2 points, so on and so forth.
        \n The object was to get the least number of points, like golf.
        \n A coach starts calling out the teams and they say at the top 3 he calls
        \n In third place Vero Beach High School, in second place with only 3 points behind 1st place is... Spanish
        River.. before he could finish that sentence my team and I start celebrating for winning first place.
        \n BY 3 POINTS! I will never forget that moment.
